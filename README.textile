h2. What is it?

*Sqwidget is a jQuery-based widget toolkit* for rapid development of multi-platform widgets.   The aim of sqwidget is to make it easy to make complex multi-platform widgets with most of the difficult work removed to allow getting on with widget making itself.

Sqwidget provides useful things like:
* automated jQuery loading plus management of required versions
* support for multiple widgets per page
* widget configuration using html data- attributes
* simple widget templates

Sqwidget can work with other extensions to add:
* CSS cleanslate and important rule management
* lightbox display
* iframes

h2. Status

Sqwidget is under pretty rapid development at the moment, as a series of function from other widget are integrated back into the core and things are moved around.  Expect changes.
