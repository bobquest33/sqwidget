h1. Sqwidget

h2. What is it?

*Sqwidget is a jQuery-based widget toolkit*, for the rapid development and deployment of simple or complex multi-platform JavaScript widget applications.

Sqwidget smooths over the complex interactions that take place within the browser, within the pages of an unknown third-party website, on a smartphone, on the desktop or dashboard, while remaining lightweight, non-blocking and based on a jQuery-style plugin architecture.

This allows widget developers to focus their time on the design and functionality of their specific application.


h2. Features

* Automated jQuery loading, or re-use from the host page
* Simple widget templates
* Plugins, similar to jQuery plugins
* Asynchronous loading
* Non-blocking of resources in the host document
* CSS sandboxing, to shield the widget from CSS in the host page
* Security sandboxing, to shield the host page and widget from potentially malicious scripts
* Support for multiple widgets per page
* Widget instance configuration via HTML5 'data-' attributes in the embed code in the host document
* Widgets are deployed via a single HTML document, with the same familiar techniques as in normal client-side development (HTML5, CSS3, Ajax, etc). No XML descriptor files are required.


h2. 'Hello world' example

The simplest widget is a text string that can be embedded somewhere else.  The embed code looks like this:

<code><div data-sqwidget="src:helloworld.html"></div>
</code>

and the source file `helloworld.html` looks like this:

<code>hello world
</code>

The result here is that the string <code>'hello world'</code> is embedded into the embed <code><div></code>.  Simple, and useful it you need to embed a little text file from somewhere into a page.
